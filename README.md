#Hackathon: HCL – Retail Data Processing Hackathon
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a complete retail data-processing pipeline that simulates a real analytics workflow:
data generation → ingestion → quality validation → storage → cleaning → loyalty calculations → RFM → segmentation → dashboards.

The primary problem solved: build a reliable loyalty insights pipeline capable of handling high-volume retail sales data with automated quality checks and customer-value segmentation.
